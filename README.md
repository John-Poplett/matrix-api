core.matrix
===========

The central objective of `core.matrix` is to make matrix and array programming
idiomatic, elegant and fast in Clojure.

```clojure
(+ [[1 2]
    [3 4]]
   (* (identity-matrix 2) 3.0))

=> [[4.0 2.0]
    [3.0 7.0]]
    
;; Note: nested Clojure vectors can be used as matrices
```

Key goals of `core.matrix`:

 - Provide a clear, standard API / abstraction for matrix and array programming in Clojure
 - Enable plugable support for different underlying matrix library implementations
 - Provide a general purpose n-dimensional array implementation (NDArray)
 - Provide a foundation layer for other projects (e.g. Incanter)
 - Maintain high performance throughout

### Getting Started

To use `core.matrix`, you can get the latest released version from Clojars:

 - https://clojars.org/net.mikera/core.matrix

For code examples see:

 - https://github.com/mikera/matrix-api/blob/master/src/main/clojure/clojure/core/matrix/examples.clj

### Documentation

For documentation and further examples see the Wiki:

### Status

`core.matrix` is fully functional and usable in production applications. As well as supporting
the standard Clojure data structures, multiple back end implementations exist that provide optimised
matrix implementations. The most mature implementations are currently:

 - [**vectorz-clj**](https://github.com/mikera/vectorz-clj) : a fast pure-JVM matrix library for Clojure
 - [**Clatrix**](https://github.com/tel/clatrix) : native code matrix library using BLAS
 - **NDArray** : a general purpose pure Clojure N-dimensional array implementation, included as part of `core.matrix` itself

However the API is still *subject to some changes* at present (at least up until release 1.0.0),
so users should be prepared to deal with potential breaking changes when updating to future releases.

The plan is to become an official Clojure Contrib language extension once the API has been well tested.
